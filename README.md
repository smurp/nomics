# Nomic Rulesets

This is just a simple collection of [Nomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic) rulesets.  Ideally they would be better formatted for printing.

**[Nomic "Classic"](https://github.com/smurp/nomics/blob/master/nomic_classic.pdf)** is the original set of rules, by Peter Suber

**[Nomic "Minimum"](https://github.com/smurp/nomics/blob/master/nomic_minimum.pdf)** is the [Minimum Nomic](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41223126) ruleset by Hatakeyama and Hashimoto
