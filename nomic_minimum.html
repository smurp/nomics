  <LI>101 - All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect.  The rules in the Initial sSet are in effect whenever a game begins.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-109.</LI>
  
  <LI>102 – A rule-change is the following: the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a rule.</LI>
  
  <LI>103 – Players shall alternate in clockwise order taking one whole turn apiece.</LI>
  
  <LI>104 – Each player proposes one rule-change and has it voted on in her/his turn.</LI>
  
  <LI>105 – A rule-change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the players.</LI>
  
  <LI>106 – An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.  Each new rule adopted shall be given a number. The numbers shall begin with 201.</LI>
  
  <LI>107 – Each player always has exactly one vote.</LI>
  
  <LI>108 – If two or more rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.</LI>
  
  <LI>109 – If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question.  Disagreement for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player.  This process is called invoking Judgement.  The next player becomes a Judge, and the Judge gives a decision. The Judge's Judgement is overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgement is overruled, the next player to Judge becomes a new Judge and gives a decision, and do as same as above until Judgement is not overruled.</LI>
